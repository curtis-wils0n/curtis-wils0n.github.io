Hi! My name is Curtis Wilson, I am a software developer based out of Calgary, Alberta. Outside of development, I am an avid tabletop roleplayer and occasional wargamer who loves to read science-fiction and fantasy (and better yet, [science fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fantasy)).

I previously spent a lot of time volunteering at local community radio stations like [CJSW 90.9FM](https://cjsw.com/) (you should check them out) and have a soft spot for live music of any kind.

The goal of this site is to join the ranks of other [Old School Revival/Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_Renaissance) (OSR) bloggers and jot down thoughts on games, systems, and modules. Maybe even some recaps of actual play sessions.

Please don't hesitate to reach out via the fediverse at [@xsword@dice.camp](https://dice.camp/@xsword). I'd love to chat!
